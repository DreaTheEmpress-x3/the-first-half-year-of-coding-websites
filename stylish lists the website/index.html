        <h2>Explaining both</h2>
      </header>
      <p class="column">Being trans is.. most definitely interesting, being looked down upon just bc we are trying to function in society by transitioning is very odd to me though people with adhd or other type stuff get also looked down upon but not in the same way, dysphoria is the most common cause to wanting a different gender or body, but it is important to note dysphoria alone doesnt make one trans.</p>
      <p class="column">Being asexual is.. annoying when all of society is so hell bent on sex and reproducing and glorifying and focusing on body rather than personality, makes it hard to find someone that you can date without the no sex being an issue, and some aces are less strict and more open to sexual stuff but we do mostly hate or not enjoy it even when doing it.</p>

        <h1>Facts about both</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Aces hate sexual activity and prefer personality and romantical bond</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Trans people dont always transition but they are still trans</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>There are different forms of being Asexual, like demisexual where you only feel stuff when you are really close with someone, or aromantic where you dont feel any romantic feelings towards anyone.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>there are also different ways to be Trans, one can transition or just stick to clothes, either way you count as valid as long as you dont use it to cause issues</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Gender and Sex(your body) is not the same.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>as an Ace you might have issues finding a partner as you are someone that doesnt do any sexual activities,and pretty much everyone does sexual stuff, so it might be hard to find someone who doesnt want you for your body alone.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>being Trans is a journey as you find and become your true self.</p>
        </li>
